 SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION
Java
Java is a programming language originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++ but has a simpler object model and fewer low-level facilities. Java applications are typically compiled to byte code (class file) that can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. Java is a general-purpose, concurrent, class-based, object-oriented language that is specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere." Java is currently one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications.

This system reuires three basic and main software techniques to be installed :
1)) Java plateform (Netbbeans 8.0)
2) wire shark ( file capturation)
3) My sql (5.6 ) for tcp dumb file storage

Object-Oriented Software Development using Java: Principles, Patterns, and Frameworks contain a much applied focus that develops skills in designing software-particularly in writing well-designed, medium-sized object-oriented programs.
Net Beans:
The Net Beans Platform is a reusable framework for simplifying the development of Java Swing desktop applications. The Net Beans IDE bundle for Java SE contains what is needed to start developing Net Beans plug-in and Net Beans Platform based applications; no additional SDK is required.
Applications can install modules dynamically. Any application can include the Update Center module to allow users of the application to download digitally-signed upgrades and new features directly into the running application. Reinstalling an upgrade or a new release does not force users to download the entire application again.

Wamp server/wireshark:
WAMPs are packages of independently-created programs installed on computers that use a Microsoft Windows operating system. WAMP is an acronym formed from the initials of the operating system Microsoft Windows and the principal components of the package: Apache, MySQL and one of PHP, Perl or Python. 
Apache is a web server. MySQL is an open-source database. PHP is a scripting language that can manipulate information held in a database and generate web pages dynamically each time content is requested by a browser. Other programs may also be included in a package, such as phpMyAdmin which provides a graphical user interface for the MySQL database manager, or the alternative scripting languages Python or Perl. Equivalent packages are MAMP (for the Apple Mac) and LAMP (for the Linux operating system).

MySQL
The MySQL development project has made its source code available under the terms of the GNU General Public License, as well as under a variety of proprietary agreements. MySQL was owned and sponsored by a single for-profit firm, the Swedish company MySQL AB, now owned by Oracle Corporation. 
Free-software-open source projects that require a full-featured database management system often use MySQL. For commercial use, several paid editions are available, and offer additional functionality. Applications which use MySQL databases include: TYPO3, Joomla, WordPress, phpBB, Drupal and other software built on the LAMP software stack. MySQL is also used in many high-profile, large-scale World Wide Web products, including Wikipedia, Google (though not for searches), Facebook, and Twitter.
